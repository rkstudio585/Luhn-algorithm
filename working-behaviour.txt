1. Set `sum` to 0.
2. Starting from the rightmost digit (last digit), process each digit one at a time:
   a. For every second digit (from the right), double the digit.
   b. If the doubled result is greater than 9, subtract 9 from the result.
   c. Add the result to `sum`.
3. Add all other (non-doubled) digits to `sum`.
4. If `sum % 10 == 0`, the number is valid according to the Luhn algorithm.
   Otherwise, it is invalid.
